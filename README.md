<h1>Fortune Teller Function!</h1>

**Instructions**

- **Create a fortuneTeller Function**  
- **Create a function named fortuneTeller that takes two arguments: name and age.**  

**Inside the function:**
- Use if statements to generate fortunes based on the name.  
- Use if statements to generate fortunes based on the age.  
- Combine the fortunes into a single string and return it.  

**Fortune Rules**  

**For names:**  
- If the name is longer than 7 characters: "will marry late in life."  
- If the name is shorter than 5 characters: "will marry within a year."  
- If the name is between 5 and 7 characters (inclusive): "will encounter a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."  
- If the first letter of the name is 'R': "will be rich."  
- If the name contains the letter 'i': "will fall in love this week."  

**For ages, students can choose their own fortune rules. Examples (do NOT use these, create your own!):**  
- If the age is less than 18: "will achieve something great in their studies."  
- If the age is between 18 and 30: "will soon find their dream job."  
- If the age is greater than 30: "will experience financial success soon."  

**Prompt the User for Input**  
- Use prompt() to ask the user for their name and age.
- Call the fortuneTeller function with the user's input and display the result using console.log.

**Bonus:**  
- Create a user interface (frontend) for the application. Include headers, paragraphs, and buttons to allow users to interact with the fortune teller.
